This repository demonstrates a common error in C++: dereferencing a null pointer.  The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides a corrected version.  Null pointer dereferences are a frequent source of crashes and undefined behavior. Always check for null pointers before dereferencing them.
